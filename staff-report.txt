Narative specification
----------------------
Using the kind of file produced by host_td, print a staff report on
demand.

The report has one line per ward, and displays the ward-id and count
of the staff in that ward. The end of the report has a total staff
line.

Include a report heading, but don't bother breaking the output into
pages.
